# PanelPlaceholder

Sometimes you have to assemble UI parts later and you could not use a prefab. (It might already contains some prefab you want to preserve the link)

By creating an empty GameObject with this script, you can replace it later with a panel. It will automatically expand the size to fit parent and stay at the exact index that the placeholder GameObject was.

# SimpleSFXSystem

This is big! It is responsible to all SFXs you can hear in Duel Otters and Mel Cadence. Basically, I want to play sounds by script with static method WITHOUT any magic strings. (e.g. SFX.PlayClick(), SFX.PlayWrong())

It's painful to write script for each SFXs by hand, so this script can turn your entire SFX folder into a playable static methods in just a few seconds. Revolutionary! But you have to learn its system a bit.

TODO :
- Generate partial class instead.
- Make it so you don't have to paste the script.
- Make it so you don't have to connect audio files.
- Add a function to play sound with string argument (as file name).

## Note

I probably will sell this in the Asset Store for small price once all the polishes are complete and remove from here. So grab it for free while you can..

# LegacyAnimator

![screenshot](ss.png)

I have a scene with 60 Animators just because Unity says officially that legacy animator is not recommended for new projects! Boy! I should not have trusted Unity! The yellow chunk was entirely by Animators and it took 9ms combined. (16ms is the target time for 60FPS)

So this makes a legacy animation more usable and more like calling triggers to Animator's mechanim graph.

# RectCam

Force the camera to render a certain aspect ratio. Like if you want to render iPhone aspect while on iPad. The empty area will not be drawn, which will be black or the previous content.

The gameplay scene of Mel Cadence uses this. On iPad you can see the letterbox on top and bottom. I did not write a single `if` for the iPad version because with this script the camera render as if I am still using an iPhone.

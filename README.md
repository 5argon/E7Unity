# E7Unity - A collection of Unity things that Exceed7 Experiments is using.

Free Unity stuff! But don't underestimate them because I have this as a Git submodule on both of my real game projects. They are **all** actively being used and are very crucial (to me).

Maybe someone else needs it, so I decided to share it for free. I don't reccommend you to submodule but just copy what you need. Also, I am **assumimg .NET 4.6** since I want to use the new C# 6.0 syntaxes for a cleaner code.

The license for everything is MIT but attribution is optional. This repo will keeps growing over time.

I am not taking any responsibility for any problem caused by this, if there are bugs, they don't compile, or causes any revenue loss to your game!

There is a `README.md` file in most folders except `Others`, which you must look at the code to figure them out by yourself. Also I am making a website for this which should be at http://exceed7.com/free-unity-stuff once it's done.

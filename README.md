# E7Unity - A collection of Unity things that Exceed7 Experiments is using.

I have this as a Git submodule on both of my real game projects. Maybe someone else needs it, so I decided to share it for free. Maybe you can submodule it too, or just copy what you want to use. The license for everything is MIT. This repo will keeps growing and updating as I develop games and made more sharable things.

I am not taking any responsibility for any problem caused by this, if there are bugs, they don't compile (should not happen since it compiles in my games...), or cause revenue loss to your game! But I think they are useful :D

There is a `README.md` file in most folders except `Others`, which you must look at the code to figure them out by yourself.

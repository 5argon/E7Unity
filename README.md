# E7Unity - A collection of Unity things that Exceed7 Experiments is using.

Free Unity stuff! But don't underestimate them because I have this as a Git submodule on both of my real game projects. They are **all** actively being used and are very crucial (to me). Maybe someone else needs it, so I decided to share it for free.

This repo has `.asmdef` because the whole thing is a Git submodule to all of my projects, but I don't recommend doing that since you will run into a lot of dependencies problem. (For example, I assume the latest C# version, assume to have some plugins, etc.) Just copy what you want and put it in an appropriate place where it can find dependencies in your project.

The license for everything is MIT. This repo will keeps growing over time.

I am not taking any responsibility for any problem caused by this, if there are bugs, they don't compile, or causes any revenue loss to your game!

There is a `README.md` file in most folders.

# TriggerOnEnter

An unbelievably simple StateMachineBehaviour which triggers to it's own Animator.

The stategy is like, you have an animation in other layer waiting for the main layer ones to finish before going on. The only way to make the other layer wait is to stop it with a trigger. To trigger, use this script so you don't have to manually "time" in the code.

Here's a collections of seemingly useless graphics, but I have use them a lot for constructing effects for my games and save a lot of graphic memories! They are reasonable sized and should be enough.

Most of them are white, so you can change them to any colors. Use Additive blending for great effects especially on those feathery-looking ones, and those are pretty resistant to enlarging!

Pack them together in one atlas!

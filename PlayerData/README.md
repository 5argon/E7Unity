# PlayerData

Use this to make a AES-encrypted binary save file when you don't want to make it plainly visible like in PlayerPrefs. It is the save file system in both Duel Otters and Mel Cadence. Knowing this, please don't try to hack the game's save file. __/|\__

It uses Protobuf as a base of save file serialization structure. You should know how Protobuf works before using this.
